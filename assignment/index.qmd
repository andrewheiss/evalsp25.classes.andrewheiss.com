The main goals of this class are to help you design, critique, code, and run rigorous, valid, and feasible evaluations of public sector programs. Each type of assignment in this class is designed to help you achieve one or more of these goals.

## Weekly check-in

Each week you'll submit a list of three most interesting and three most unclear things from the readings. ([See the complete instructions and details here](/assignment/weekly-check-in.qmd)).


## Problem sets

To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets. 

You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:

- ✔+: (*33 points (110%) in gradebook*) Assignment is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.
- ✔: (*30 points (100%) in gradebook*) Assignment is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. **This is the expected level of performance.**
- ✔−: (*15 points (50%) in gradebook*) Assignment is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.

You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but *you must turn in your own answers.* You cannot work in groups of more than **four** people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.


## Evaluation assignments

For your [final project](/assignment/final-project.qmd), you will conduct a pre-registered evaluation of a social program using synthetic data. To (1) give you practice with the principles of program evaluation, research design, measurement, and causal diagrams, and (2) help you with the foundation of your final project, you will complete a set of four evaluation-related assignments. 

Ideally these will become major sections of your final project. However, there is no requirement that the programs you use in these assignments must be the same as the final project. If, through these assignments, you discover that your initially chosen program is too simple, too complex, too boring, etc., you can change at any time.

These assignments will be graded using a check system:

- ✔+: (*33 points (110%) in gradebook*) Assignment is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.
- ✔: (*30 points (100%) in gradebook*) Assignment is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. **This is the expected level of performance.**
- ✔−: (*15 points (50%) in gradebook*) Assignment is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.


## Exams

There will be two exams covering (1) program evaluation, design, and causation, and (2) the core statistical tools of program evaluation and causal inference.

You will take these exams online through iCollege. The exams will have a time limit, but you can use notes and readings and [the Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ45fO1uiOQ). You must take the exams on your own though, and not talk to anyone about them.


## #TidyTuesday

At some point before the end of the semester, you'll need to (1) take a dataset, (2) do something neat with it, and (3) share it with the public somehow. ([See the complete instructions and details here](/assignment/tidy-tuesday.qmd)).


## Final project

At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of program evaluation and causal inference by completing a final project.

[Complete details for the final project are here.](/assignment/final-project.qmd)

There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.
