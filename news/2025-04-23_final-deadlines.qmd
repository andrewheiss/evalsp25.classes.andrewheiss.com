Hi everyone!

- Everything except the final project needs to be turned in by **11:59 PM on Tuesday, April 29** (that's the day after GSU's last day of classes)
- The final project has to be submitted by **11:59 PM on Monday, May 5** (I have to submit grades shortly thereafter)

I won't accept late work beyond those two deadlines so make sure you get stuff in by then!
