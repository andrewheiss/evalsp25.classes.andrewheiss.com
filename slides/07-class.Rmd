A correlational study found that MS was strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) - they don't know the exact mechanism yet, but because of mRNA vaccine technology, they can develop vaccines against EBV and help stop MS. They'll figure out exact mechanisms later. For now, they've started clinical trials.

First, notice that the statements are always about the population parameter, which considers all American adults for the energy polls or all New York adults for the quarantine poll.

We also avoided another common mistake: incorrect language might try to describe the confidence interval as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability. Making a probability interpretation is a common error: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the given interval.

Another important consideration of confidence intervals is that they are only about the population parameter. A confidence interval says nothing about individual observations or point estimates. Confidence intervals only provide a plausible range for population parameters.

> a Bayesian statistician would say “given our observed data, there is a 95% probability that the true value of θ falls within the credible region” while a Frequentist statistician would say “there is a 95% probability that when I compute a confidence interval from data of this sort, the true value of θ will fall within it”.
(https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/18117)

> Note how this drastically improve the interpretability of the Bayesian interval compared to the frequentist one. Indeed, the Bayesian framework allows us to say “given the observed data, the effect has 95% probability of falling within this range”, compared to the less straightforward, frequentist alternative (the 95% Confidence* Interval) would be “there is a 95% probability that when computing a confidence interval from data of this sort, the effect falls within this range”.

There's a 95% probability that the range contains the true value (freq) - We are 95% confident that this net captures the true population parameter
vs.
There's a 95% probability that the the true value falls in this range (bayes)

This is a minor linguistic difference but it actually matters a lot! With frequentism, you have a range of possible values - you don't really know the true parameter, but it's in that range somewhere. Could be at the very edge, could be in the middle. With Bayesianism, you focus on the parameter itself, which has a distribution around it. It could be on the edge, but is most likely in the middle

Probability of range boundaries vs probability of parameter values

Bayesian p-value = probability that it's greater than 0 - you can say that there's a 100% chance that the coefficient is not zero, no more null worlds!
